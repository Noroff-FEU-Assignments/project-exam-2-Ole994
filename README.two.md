About this project:

This is a project where you can see how to fetch data from an Api and display it on the website and how to make a login page that redirect to an adminpage.
On the front page the title of each result is displayed as well as the date when each product where created. This was done using javascript and html in react.

On the contact page and loginpage forms have been created to show how to use walidation when someone types in a name, email, subject and a message. Yup (a package in react) is used to do that, and you will get errors if some of these inputs are incorrect.
The errors will disappear if you type in the correct. Since the focus on the project is javascript, the styling is not very good.

The tech stack for this project are the frameworks react.js, strapi and sass.

And for the installation for the different packages, Yarn is used.
